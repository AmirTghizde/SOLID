Okay let's say we have this user class.


```java
 public class User {
    private String firstname;
    private String surname;
    private String email;
    private String password;

    // Getters, setters and constructor

    public void printInfoInConsole(){
        System.out.println("Firstname: " + firstname);
        System.out.println("Surname: " + surname);
        System.out.println("Email: " + email);
        System.out.println("Password: " + password);
    }

    public void sendEmail(String subject, String message) {
        // code for sending emails
        System.out.println("Email sent to " + email + ": " + subject + " - " + message);
    }

    public String generateProfilePictureUrl() {
        // code for generating profile pic url
        return "https://example.com/profile/" + email + ".jpg";
    }
}

```
   
In the given code snippet, the User class appears to violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which states that a class should have only one reason to change. In this case, the User class is responsible for managing user information and performing email-related functionalities. Let's delve into the violation and propose a refactoring solution

## Handling
To adhere to the **Single Responsibility Principle**, it is important to reduce the burden of responsibilities within this class. One approach to achieve this is by separating the responsibilities into different classes.

By separating the responsibilities, we can create a more modular and maintainable codebase.

```java
public class ProfileGenerator {
    public String generateProfilePictureUrl(String email) {
        // implementation code to generate the profile picture URL
        return "https://example.com/profile/" + email + ".jpg";
    }
}

```
```java
public class EmailSender {
    public void sendEmail(String recipientEmail, String subject, String message) {
        // implementation code to send the email
        System.out.println("Email sent to " + recipientEmail + ": " + subject + " - " + message);
    }
}
```
Here's how our User class would look after separating responsibilities:
```java
public class User {
    private String firstname;
    private String surname;
    private String email;
    private String password;

    public User(String firstname, String surname, String email, String password) {
        this.firstname = firstname;
        this.surname = surname;
        this.email = email;
        this.password = password;
    }

    // Getters and setters

    // ...

    public void printInfoInConsole() {
        System.out.println("Firstname: " + firstname);
        System.out.println("Surname: " + surname);
        System.out.println("Email: " + email);
        System.out.println("Password: " + password);
    }
}
```
